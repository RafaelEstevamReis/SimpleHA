# SimpleHA
A simple c# Home-Assistant library


Home-Assitant has a developer docs webpage, but with almost nothing in it.

There are only some endpoints (eg the `api/stream` is not documented) with no model specification

Some (almost none) source documentation: https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/api/rest/
